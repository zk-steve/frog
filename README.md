## Introduction

Welcome to **Frog**, a template project for building real-world MPC (Multi-Party Computation) systems using
the [Phantom library](https://github.com/gausslabs/phantom-zone/tree/rewrite).

## How to Run

Step-by-step instructions for running the project are available [here](docs/how_to_run.md).

## Architecture

Learn more about the system's architecture [here](docs/architecture.md).

## Future Plans

- [ ] Finalize Docker and Kurtosis configurations to simplify deployment on Docker or Kubernetes.
- [ ] Complete the implementation of the worker service and database (currently, the server processes tasks and stores
  data locally).
- [ ] Develop a toolkit similar to [Ignite](https://github.com/ignite/cli) to streamline the development process with a
  CLI for scaffolding and managing projects.
- [ ] Add more documentation and comments in the codebase to enhance maintainability and usability.
